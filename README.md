The Main branch is the Java overhaul, the master was the pre java overhaul!
add JFreeCharts to project to run. you might have to download them from the repo right quick and then
do this by going to file -> project structure -> Modules -> click Dependencies tab -> + sign below Module SDK -> JARs or Directories -> select JAR files.
I have them added to the repo under src -> resources
